# User Re-engagement

In the digital age, user re-engagement is a critical factor for the success of online platforms. To achieve higher user re-engagement, understanding user behavior and predicting their actions is crucial. This project aims to address this challenge by predicting whether a user will return to their session after a brief 5-minute break. The dataset used her is the Galaxy Zoo dataset from Citizen Science.
Our approach combines machine learning techniques with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection to provide accurate predictions. By identifying users likely to reengage, online platforms can tailor their strategies to boost user retention and satisfaction.
This project utilizes various data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to achieve its goal.

The Galaxy Zoo project relies upon volunteer participants to identify types of galaxies by looking at
images which are allocated to them during a session. Each row in the dataset contains
a user HIT. A user HIT consists of a user ID and a time-stamp that indicates when a user made a contribution
to the project. A user session is a sequence of user HITs for the same user where consecutive HITs are not
separated by more than 30 minutes i.e., if a specific user HIT is more than 30 minutes after her
previous HIT, this user is assumed to be in a new session.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to predict whether a user will return to their session after a 5-minute break.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any machine learning project. In this project, we handle:

- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Standardization and normalization of numerical features.
- Dealing with class imbalance through upsampling.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves selecting, transforming, or creating new features to improve model performance. Key feature engineering techniques include:

- Selecting relevant features using SelectKBest and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
- Handling temporal features and session-related information.

## Model Selection

We explore multiple machine learning models, including:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest Classifier

## Hyperparameter Tuning

To optimize model performance, hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV. This helps us find the best hyperparameters for each model.

## Performance Evaluation

The project evaluates model performance using several metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall

## Visualizations

We create various visualizations to gain insights from the data, explore feature distributions, and understand model performance.
